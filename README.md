# Yash Satish Patil - Personal Portfolio

This is the source code for my personal portfolio website, designed to showcase my skills, projects, and academic achievements.

## Project Structure

This portfolio is built using static files:

- **`index.html`**: The main structure and content of the website.
- **`style.css`**: The external stylesheet for all design and responsive layouts.
- **`README.md`**: Project documentation.
- **`Images/`**: This folder contains all visual assets, including the profile picture, academic records, and certifications.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** (Structure)
- **CSS3** (Styling and Responsiveness)
- **JavaScript** (Section navigation)

## How to View Locally

1.  Download or clone the repository.
2.  Ensure you have the correct folder structure (an `Images` folder containing all assets next to `index.html`).
3.  Open the `index.html` file directly in any web browser.

## Deployment Status

This portfolio is deployed via **GitHub Pages** for easy, public access.
